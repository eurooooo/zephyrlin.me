## What are agents?

The article introduces a term "agentic systems", which includes two types: workflows and agents.

> - Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
> - Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

## The simplest solution is often the best.

> When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all.
